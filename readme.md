# A Experiment Automation Framework for Brain-Inspired Computing

This repository contains the source code for the Experiment Automation Framework (EAF) for Brain-Inspired Computing. A personal project for improving my daily research efficiency.

## Installation

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Basic Usage

An experiment is abstracted into the following components:

- **Experiment Procedure**: The procedure that the experiment follows, like training a model, testing a model, etc.
- **Parameters**: The parameters that the experiment uses as configuration. These parameters can be changed to run the experiment with different configurations, which is the core of the experiment automation.
- **Data**: The data that the experiment uses. This can be a dataset, a model, etc.

Still in development. More details will be added soon.
